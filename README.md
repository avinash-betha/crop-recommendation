# crop-recommendation

In this agricultural crop recommendation project, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model was trained, achieving an impressive accuracy of 96.14%. 
Following successful training, the model was converted to TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) format to optimize its deployment on mobile devices. 
The integration of the TFLite model into the Android Studio environment enabled the creation of a user-friendly mobile application. 
This application utilizes the trained model to predict suitable crops based on input parameters, providing farmers with valuable insights for optimal crop selection. 
The high accuracy of the model enhances its reliability, making it a robust tool for supporting farmers in making informed decisions about crop choices, 
ultimately contributing to more efficient and sustainable agricultural practices.
Furthermore, the project is actively evolving to enhance its real-time capabilities. 
Efforts are underway to optimize the model for efficient inference on mobile devices, ensuring swift and seamless crop recommendations directly in the field.
The ultimate goal is to create a robust, real-time crop recommendation system that empowers farmers with timely and accurate insights, 
thereby contributing to increased productivity and sustainability in agriculture.
